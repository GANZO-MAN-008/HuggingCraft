### How to run
1. Register on ngrok
2. Get access key
3. Make in "Repository secrets" new secret "NGROK_TOKEN" what contains access key
4. Upload new server files and/or customize them (DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE YOURSELF AN OPERATOR; also do not forget server core!!)
5. Start this Docker!

### How to join
1. Go to ngrok's dashboard
2. Go to tunnels -> agents
3. You will see active agent. Click on it
4. You will see agent's ip, region and tunnel what ngrok made to connect to server. This is ip of server <img width="1440" alt="Снимок экрана 2024-04-12 в 14 11 56" src="https://github.com/imperialwool/HuggingCraft/assets/55358751/0a8c97f4-8106-4aab-88ad-5b946bd2dc8f">
5. Enter this ip as minecraft server's ip (without tcp://)
6. Play

## Suggestions for users
1. How about DiscordSRV? You can control the server easily and you will need only configure the server settings
2. Maybe any other easy ways to make it works? Idk, i did so complicated work, but its work!!!!!!! :D

## Be careful!
1. Files are NOT saving, maybe later will fix that but idk how
2. If your repository gets deleted or your account gets blocked, its not my fault; imm just giving you the code, its up to you to use it, how to use it and etc

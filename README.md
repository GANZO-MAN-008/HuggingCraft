----
### Instruction:
1. Register on ngrok
2. Get access key
3. Make in "Repository secrets" new secret "NGROK_TOKEN" what contains access key
4. Upload new server files and/or customize them (DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE YOURSELF AN OPERATOR; also do not forget server core!!)
5. Start this Docker!

### Suggestions for users:
1. How about DiscordSRV? You can control the server easily and you will need only configure the server settings
2. Maybe any other easy ways to make it works? Idk, i did so complicated work, but its work!!!!!!! :D

### Be careful!
1. Files are NOT saving, maybe later will fix that but idk how
2. If your repository gets deleted or your account gets blocked, its not my fault; imm just giving you the code, its up to you to use it, how to use it and etc
